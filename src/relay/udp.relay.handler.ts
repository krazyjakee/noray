/**
 * Class implementing the actual relay logic.
 *
 * The relay handler keeps an internal table of relay entries and a socket pool.
 *
 * Whenever a new relay is added, the socket pool ensures that we have the
 * necessary local port allocated to listen for incoming traffic on that port.
 *
 * When traffic arrives on any of the listening ports, it is first checked in
 * the translation table. If there's an entry both for the sender AND target,
 * the traffic is forwarded as-is, through the port dedicated to the sender.
 *
 * Example: Port 1 is allocated for Host, port 2 is allocated for Client. When
 * we get a packet targeting port 1 from Client, we use port 2 to relay the data
 * to Host. This way, Client will always appear as Noray:2 to the Host.
